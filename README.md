# QAJavaScriptProject

Why are we doing this?

The project allows us to consolidate our learning of JavaScript and HTML over the last 5 weeks, as well as an opportunity to test our learning by working independently without having the expertise and immediate support of the instructor

How did I expect the challenge to go?

I anticipated that there would be certain points in the project where I would get stuck and have to do some research or need support to get through issues or errors but that I would be able to finish the project on time. 

What went well?

I enjoyed being able to work at my own pace and having time to work out issue for myself that I might not have had time to do during the academy. I feel that this has helped me to progress with my learning. 

What didnâ€™t go as planned?

Due to laptop failure at the beginning of the week which was not able to be replaced until Wednesday, I lost two days to work on the project. This lead to a feeling of being behind and rushing for the rest of the week and I think I could have improved on the project had this not happened. 
I also found it necessary to spend more that the allotted 10 hours on the project to get it finished

Possible improvements for future

Given more time I would like to have condensed the code and made it shorter. I would also like to spend more time in CSS on the style aspect of the project
